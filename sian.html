        <p>Summary of Sian Caine's contribution to the LAIDS PROJECT</p>
        <p>
          For my contribution to the LAIDS Project, I developed and evaluated two lightweight AI-based Intrusion Detection Systems 
          optimized for resource-constrained networks:
        </p>
        <ul class="clean">
          <li>A hybrid Convolutional Neural Network/Gated Recurrent Unit (CNN-GRU) model.</li>
          <li>A hybrid GAN-MLP Generative Adversarial Network/Multilayer Perceptron model.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These models were benchmarked against a baseline 1D CNN-based IDS using the CICIDS 2017 dataset. To further investigate model efficiency, I also restructured the baseline 1D CNN into a 2D CNN to explore how introducing a second dimension would affect overall performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The results showed that both the 2D CNN and CNN-GRU models are viable for lightweight real-world deployment. The CNN-GRU achieved the best overall multi-class classification performance, while the 2D CNN excelled in detecting unseen attacks. However, the GAN-MLP model underperformed due to the limitations of its lightweight architecture.

              This literature review examines developments, challenges, and breakthroughs in intrusion detection system (IDS) 
              frameworks. It specifically investigates the feasibility of implementing lightweight AI-based IDSs in low-resource networks.
              The findings of this review provided the foundation for the design and development of the lightweight AI-IDS models 
              presented in the final study.
              
              This review examines both traditional and AI-based IDS methods, as well as existing datasets and commonly used 
              evaluation metrics. It then provides a detailed comparison of traditional IDSs with AI-based IDSs, and of 
              machine learning IDSs with deep learning IDSs. The feasibility of implementing a lightweight DL or ML-DL hybrid 
              IDS is also assessed, along with the implications of the reviewed literature for the LAIDS project. Finally, 
              conclusions are drawn, and a path forward for the LAIDS project is outlined.

              Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have become crucial to networks, particularly with the growth of IoT, 
              rising cybercrime and increasingly sophisticated threats. Traditional intrusion detection
              systems struggle to scale effectively with these increases and to
              detect zero-day attacks. AI-based IDSs offer improved detection
              accuracy and adaptability, but are often too resource-intensive. The
              LAIDS (Lightweight AI-based Intrusion Detection System) project
              aims to address this gap by designing and evaluating lightweight
              AI-IDS models that balance strong detection capabilities with low
              resource usage. Three core model architectures are explored in this paper: a
              baseline CNN, a PCA-CNN and an AE-MLP, which are trained
              and evaluated with the CICIDS2017 dataset. These models, along
              with their quantised variants, are evaluated on their classification
              performance, resource efficiency and their ability to generalise to
              'zero-day attacks'. The paper advances AI-based IDS solutions and demonstrates their suitability
              for resource-constrained environments.
