        <h2>Overview of My Final Paper </h2>
        <!-- ENTER OVERVIRE OF YOUR PROJECT HERE -->
        <p>A summary of my contributions and key findings in the LAIDS Study:</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          My contribution to the LAIDS Project involved developing, quantising, and 
          evaluating three lightweight AI-based intrusion detection system models 
          optimised for resource-constrained networks. The objective of this study was to investigate 
          whether these models and their quantised variants could perform as well as or better than the 
          baseline model and its quantised versions, while being more resource-efficient. 
          Additionally, the study examined the models' ability to detect previously unseen attack 
          classes in comparison to the baseline model.
        </p>
        <p>These models developed were:</pp>
        <ul class="clean">
          <li>A baseline one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network model (CNN), which was co-developed with my fellow LAIDS project members</li>
          <li>A Principle Component Analysis enhanced Convolutional Neural Network model (PCA-CNN)</li>
          <li>A hybrid Autoencoder-Multilayer Perceptron (AE-MLP) model</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          The models were trained and evaluated using the CICIDS2017 dataset 
          across three experiments: benchmarking, quantisation, and generalisation to unseen data. 
          Performance metrics such as accuracy, false negative rate, inference latency, and CPU time were 
          recorded and compared to address the study's research questions.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          The findings suggested that no model consistently outperformed the baseline in terms of detection 
          performance and resource efficiency. However, each model demonstrated targeted performance gains 
          over the baseline. Notably, the dynamically INT8-quantised PCA-CNN demonstrated the most promise 
          for deployment as a lightweight intrusion detection system. The model achieved some of the lowest 
          CPU processing times, inference latency, and false negative rates. 
          Furthermore, the model attained the highest detection rate for DoS samples when they 
          were given as zero-day attacks.

              This literature review examines developments, challenges, and breakthroughs in intrusion detection system (IDS) 
              frameworks. It specifically investigates the feasibility of implementing lightweight AI-based IDSs in low-resource networks.
              The findings of this review provided the foundation for the design and development of the lightweight AI-IDS models 
              presented in the final study.
              
              This review examines both traditional and AI-based IDS methods, as well as existing datasets and commonly used 
              evaluation metrics. It then provides a detailed comparison of traditional IDSs with AI-based IDSs, and of 
              machine learning IDSs with deep learning IDSs. The feasibility of implementing a lightweight DL or ML-DL hybrid 
              IDS is also assessed, along with the implications of the reviewed literature for the LAIDS project. Finally, 
              conclusions are drawn, and a path forward for the LAIDS project is outlined.

              Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have become crucial to networks, particularly with the growth of IoT, 
              rising cybercrime and increasingly sophisticated threats. Traditional intrusion detection
              systems struggle to scale effectively with these increases and to
              detect zero-day attacks. AI-based IDSs offer improved detection
              accuracy and adaptability, but are often too resource-intensive. The
              LAIDS (Lightweight AI-based Intrusion Detection System) project
              aims to address this gap by designing and evaluating lightweight
              AI-IDS models that balance strong detection capabilities with low
              resource usage. Three core model architectures are explored in this paper: a
              baseline CNN, a PCA-CNN and an AE-MLP, which are trained
              and evaluated with the CICIDS2017 dataset. These models, along
              with their quantised variants, are evaluated on their classification
              performance, resource efficiency and their ability to generalise to
              'zero-day attacks'. The paper advances AI-based IDS solutions and demonstrates their suitability
              for resource-constrained environments.
