        <h2>Contributions to the LAIDS Study</h2> 
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          My contributions to the LAIDS Project involved developing, quantising, and 
          evaluating three lightweight AI-based intrusion detection system models 
          optimised for resource-constrained networks. The objective of this study was to investigate 
          whether these models and their quantised variants could perform as well as or better than the 
          baseline model and its quantised versions, while being more resource-efficient. 
          Additionally, the study examined the models' ability to detect previously unseen attack 
          classes in comparison to the baseline model.

        <ul class="list">
          <li>A baseline one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network model (CNN), which was co-developed with my fellow LAIDS project members</li>

            <p style="text-align: justify;color: white;font-size: 16px; font-weight:500;">
              The purpose of this experiment was to establish a performance and resource baseline by benchmarking the initial full precision 
              (FP32) models against the baseline CNN. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Benchmarking provided a fair comparison across the different model architectures and helped
              in answering the first research question of this study. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Additionally, benchmarking determined whether the quantised versions of the 
              models maintained comparable performance while improving resource efficiency.

            <p style="text-align: justify;color: white;font-size: 16px; font-weight:500;">
              This experiment investigated the impact of quantisation on the performance and resource efficiency of the FP32 baseline CNN, PCA-CNN, and 
              AE-MLP models, addressing the second research question of this study. 
              <br>
              <br>
              It evaluated the performance and resource consumption of the quantised 
              variants (FP16, dynamic INT8, and full INT8) of the full precision (FP32) PCA-CNN and AE-MLP models.These quantised models were subsequently 
              compared to the corresponding quantised versions of the baseline CNN.

              This experiment evaluated the ability of the models and their quantised variants to generalise to previously unseen, zero-day attacks, 
              addressing the third research question of this study. 
              <br>
              <br>
              The objective of the experiment was to simulate realistic zero-day attack scenarios 
              and assess whether the models could learn generalisable patterns of malicious behaviour rather than memorising known attack signatures.

            <p style="text-align: justify;color: white;font-size: 16px; font-weight:500;">
              The baseline CNN achieved the highest accuracy (95.39%) and the lowest false positive rate (5.89%). 
              However, the PCA-CNN provided a better recall rate (99.71%) along with faster CPU processing and inference times (0.048 ms and 0.0493 ms, respectively). 
              Finally, the AE-MLP offered higher precision (90.53%) than the baseline model as well as the use of less memory (2.627 KB).

            <p style="text-align: justify;color: white;font-size: 16px; font-weight:500;">
              As the models underwent quantisation and were reduced in size, their overall performance decreased. The quantised PCA models, however, 
              still continued to offer faster CPU processing and inference times compared to the baseline CNN models. Notably, the FP16 AE-MLP model 
              achieved the lowest memory usage.

            <p style="text-align: justify;color: white;font-size: 16px; font-weight:500;">
              The PCA-CNN models generally showed slightly better detection performance than the baseline CNN models (approximately 2-3% higher). 
              However, the semi-supervised AE-MLP achieved detection rates of around 60% for both DoS and Bot attacks, which were comparable to the PCA-CNN's DoS detection rate.
              This indicated that the AE-MLP could provide more consistent detection performance across different attack types. 
              Overall, the models were able to detect DoS attacks more effectively than previously unseen Bot attacks.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2> 
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          The findings suggested that no model consistently outperformed the baseline in terms of detection performance and resource efficiency. 
          However, each model demonstrated specific performance gains over the baseline. Notably, the dynamically INT8-quantised PCA-CNN showed the 
          most promise for deployment as a lightweight intrusion detection system, achieving some of the lowest CPU processing times, inference latency, 
          and false negative rates. Furthermore, it attained one of the highest detection rates for DoS samples when presented as zero-day attacks. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Overall, the findings indicated that developing a lightweight, effective IDS for resource-constrained networks may require combining feature 
          reduction techniques, such as PCA, with semi-supervised learning approaches. This balance could help achieve strong detection accuracy, efficient 
          resource usage, and improved detection of novel threats.

              <b>Abstract:</b> This literature review examined developments, challenges, and breakthroughs in intrusion detection system (IDS) frameworks. 
              It specifically investigated the feasibility of implementing lightweight AI-based IDSs in low-resource networks. The findings of this review 
              provided the foundation for the design and development of the lightweight AI-IDS models presented in the final study. The review covered both 
              traditional and AI-based IDS methods, as well as existing datasets and commonly used evaluation metrics. It then provided a detailed comparison 
              of traditional IDSs with AI-based IDSs, and of machine learning IDSs with deep learning IDSs. The feasibility of implementing a lightweight DL or 
              ML-DL hybrid IDS was also assessed, along with the implications of the reviewed literature for the LAIDS project. Finally, conclusions were drawn, 
              and a path forward for the LAIDS project was outlined.

              <b>Abstract:</b> Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have become crucial to networks, particularly with the growth of IoT, 
              rising cybercrime and increasingly sophisticated threats. Traditional intrusion detection
              systems struggle to scale effectively with these increases and to
              detect zero-day attacks. AI-based IDSs offer improved detection
              accuracy and adaptability, but are often too resource-intensive. The
              LAIDS (Lightweight AI-based Intrusion Detection System) project
              aims to address this gap by designing and evaluating lightweight
              AI-IDS models that balance strong detection capabilities with low
              resource usage. Three core model architectures are explored in this paper: a
              baseline CNN, a PCA-CNN and an AE-MLP, which are trained
              and evaluated with the CICIDS2017 dataset. These models, along
              with their quantised variants, are evaluated on their classification
              performance, resource efficiency and their ability to generalise to
              'zero-day attacks'. The paper advances AI-based IDS solutions and demonstrates their suitability
              for resource-constrained environments.
