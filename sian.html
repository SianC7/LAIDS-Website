        <h2>Overview of My Final Paper </h2> 
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">A summary of my contributions and key findings in the LAIDS Study:</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          My contribution to the LAIDS Project involved developing, quantising, and 
          evaluating three lightweight AI-based intrusion detection system models 
          optimised for resource-constrained networks. The objective of this study was to investigate 
          whether these models and their quantised variants could perform as well as or better than the 
          baseline model and its quantised versions, while being more resource-efficient. 
          Additionally, the study examined the models' ability to detect previously unseen attack 
          classes in comparison to the baseline model.

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Benchmarking</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;color: white;">
              The purpose of this experiment is to establish a performance and
              resource baseline by benchmarking the initial full precision (FP32)
              models against the baseline CNN. Benchmarking provides a fair
              comparison across the different model architectures and aids in
              answering the first research question of this study. Additionally,
              benchmarking determines whether the quantised versions of the
              models maintained comparable performance while improving resource efficiency.
            </p>

          <!-- Block 2 -->
          <div class="exp-sub-block">
            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Quantisation</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;color: white;">
              This experiment investigates the impact of quantisation on the
              performance and resource efficiency of the FP32 baseline CNN,
              PCA-CNN and AE-MLP models, addressing the second research
              question of this study. This experiment evaluates the performance
              and resource consumption of the quantised variants (FP16, dynamic
              INT8 and full INT8) of the full precision (FP32) PCA-CNN and AE-
              MLP models. These quantised models are subsequently compared
              to the corresponding quantised versions of the baseline CNN.

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Generalisation</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;color: white;">
              This experiment evaluates the ability of the models and their quantised variants to 
              generalise to previously unseen, zero-day attacks,
              addressing the third research question of this study. The objective
              of this experiment is to simulate realistic zero-day attack scenarios
              and assess whether the models can learn generalisable patterns of
              malicious behaviour rather than memorising known attack signatures.

              The Baseline CNN achieved the highest accuracy and the lowest false positive rate. 
              However, the PCA-CNN provided a better recall rate along with faster CPU processing and inference times. 
              Finally, the AE-MLP offered the highest precision while using the least amount of memory.

            <p style="text-align: justify;color: white;">
              As the models were reduced in size, their overall performance decreased. 
              The quantised PCA models, however, continued to offer faster CPU processing and inference times compared to the Baseline CNN models. 
              The FP16 AE-MLP model achieved the lowest memory usage.

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Generalisation</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;color: white;">
              The PCA-CNN models generally showed slightly better detection performance than the Baseline CNN models, particularly for unknown DoS attacks.
              However, the semi-supervised AE-MLP achieved detection rates for both DoS and Bot attacks that were comparable to the PCA-CNN's DoS detection rate. 
              This indicates that the AE-MLP can provide more consistent detection performance across different attack types.

              This literature review examines developments, challenges, and breakthroughs in intrusion detection system (IDS) 
              frameworks. It specifically investigates the feasibility of implementing lightweight AI-based IDSs in low-resource networks.
              The findings of this review provided the foundation for the design and development of the lightweight AI-IDS models 
              presented in the final study.
              
              This review examines both traditional and AI-based IDS methods, as well as existing datasets and commonly used 
              evaluation metrics. It then provides a detailed comparison of traditional IDSs with AI-based IDSs, and of 
              machine learning IDSs with deep learning IDSs. The feasibility of implementing a lightweight DL or ML-DL hybrid 
              IDS is also assessed, along with the implications of the reviewed literature for the LAIDS project. Finally, 
              conclusions are drawn, and a path forward for the LAIDS project is outlined.

              Abstract: Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have become crucial to networks, particularly with the growth of IoT, 
              rising cybercrime and increasingly sophisticated threats. Traditional intrusion detection
              systems struggle to scale effectively with these increases and to
              detect zero-day attacks. AI-based IDSs offer improved detection
              accuracy and adaptability, but are often too resource-intensive. The
              LAIDS (Lightweight AI-based Intrusion Detection System) project
              aims to address this gap by designing and evaluating lightweight
              AI-IDS models that balance strong detection capabilities with low
              resource usage. Three core model architectures are explored in this paper: a
              baseline CNN, a PCA-CNN and an AE-MLP, which are trained
              and evaluated with the CICIDS2017 dataset. These models, along
              with their quantised variants, are evaluated on their classification
              performance, resource efficiency and their ability to generalise to
              'zero-day attacks'. The paper advances AI-based IDS solutions and demonstrates their suitability
              for resource-constrained environments.
