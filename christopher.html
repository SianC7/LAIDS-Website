        <h2>Overview of My Final Paper</h2>
        <p>A summary of my contributions and key findings in the LAIDS Project:</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          My contribution to the LAIDS Project involved developing and evaluating two
          lightweight AI-based Intrusion Detection Systems optimised for resource-constrained
          networks. These models were designed to address security vulnerabilities in
          low-resource environments such as IoT and edge devices while maintaining
          strong detection capabilities.
        </p>

        <ul class="clean">
          <li>A hybrid Convolutional Neural Network / Gated Recurrent Unit (CNN-GRU) model</li>
          <li>A hybrid Generative Adversarial Network / Multilayer Perceptron (GAN-MLP) model</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          These models were benchmarked against a baseline 1D CNN-based IDS using the
          CICIDS 2017 dataset. To further investigate model efficiency, I restructured the
          baseline into a 2D CNN to analyse how an added spatial dimension impacts
          detection accuracy and resource usage.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          Results showed that both the 2D CNN and CNN-GRU models performed well for
          lightweight deployment. The CNN-GRU achieved the best overall multi-class
          classification accuracy, while the 2D CNN excelled at detecting unseen attacks.
          However, the GAN-MLP model underperformed due to architectural limitations
          inherent to lightweight adversarial frameworks.

            The rise of Internet of Things devices has increased cybersecurity risks in resource-limited networks. 
            This literature review summarises the current academic research AI-Based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) 
            as a viable solution in resource-constrained networks and served as the basis for the project's 
            CNN implementations as well as the CNN-GRU and GAN-MLP model implementations.
            Traditional IDSs are compared with their AI-based counterparts. Machine learning methods such as 
            Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR) and K-means clustering are evaluated for e
            fficient preprocessing, while deep learning models including CNNs, 
            Autoencoders and GANs enhance detection accuracy. 
            The review finds that hybrid models as the most effective for balancing performance and efficiency, 
            and concludes that optimised AI techniques can enable real-time intrusion detection in low-resource 
            network environments.

              My final paper presents the LAIDS project's completed methodology of the development and evaluation of the proposed lightweight AI-IDSs. 
              The paper evaluates model performance across three metrics: multi-classification ability, resource usage, and their ability to detect unknown attacks. 
              The CNN-GRU achieved 99% accuracy, precision, and recall with a 0.003% false positive rate, demonstrating exceptional threat detection with minimal false alarms. 
              The 2D CNN was the most effective at detecting unknown attacks, detecting 65.7% of DoS and 63.3% of DDoS zero-day threats. Post-training quantization successfully reduced the memory footprints of the models, 
              from 64MB to as low as 0.2MB while preserving their multi-classification performance. CPU utilisation was influenced more by architectural constraints than by quantization. 
              The paper demonstrates that both the 2D CNN and CNN-GRU models are viable for lightweight real-world deployment.
