          <h2 class="display">Overview of my final paper</h2>
          <p>A summary of my contributions and key findings in the LAIDS Project:</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          My contribution to the LAIDS Project involved developing and evaluating two
          lightweight AI-based Intrusion Detection Systems optimised for resource-constrained
          networks. These models were designed to address security vulnerabilities in
          low-resource environments such as IoT and edge devices while maintaining
          strong detection capabilities.
        </p>

        <ul class="checklist light">
          <li>A hybrid Convolutional Neural Network / Gated Recurrent Unit (CNN-GRU) model</li>
          <li>A hybrid Generative Adversarial Network / Multilayer Perceptron (GAN-MLP) model</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          These models were benchmarked against a baseline 1D CNN-based IDS using the
          CICIDS 2017 dataset. To further investigate model efficiency, I restructured the
          baseline into a 2D CNN to analyse how an added spatial dimension impacts
          detection accuracy and resource usage.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          Results showed that both the 2D CNN and CNN-GRU models performed well for
          lightweight deployment. The CNN-GRU achieved the best overall multi-class
          classification accuracy, while the 2D CNN excelled at detecting unseen attacks.
          However, the GAN-MLP model underperformed due to architectural limitations
          inherent to lightweight adversarial frameworks.

          <h2 class="display">Problem Statement & Research Question</h2>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          The LAIDS project addresses the vulnerability of low-resource environments such as IoT networks and edge devices to cyberattacks. 
          Existing IDSs are either too resource-intensive or lack the ability to detect zero-day attacks. 
          I chose to explore the application of a GAN-MLP and CNN-GRU based IDS. 
          As such my paper sought to answer the question:
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          <b>
            How can a Hybrid CNN-GRU or GAN-based IDS outperform a CNN-based IDS in terms of zero-day attack detection, 
            detection accuracy, false positive rate, and computational resource usage in a resource-constrained network 
            environment?

            <h4>Experiment 1: Multi Classification Performance</h4>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
              This experiment evaluates the multi-classification performance of proposed models and 
              establishes a baseline benchmark for each of the architectures. The models were trained 
              with preprocessing, early stopping, and validation monitoring, while GANs required manual selection. 
              The models were evaluated on their: accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score and false positive rate.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              This experiment assesses the impact of post-training quantization on model performance and resource use. 
              The baseline models underwent dynamic and full quantization including FP32, FP16 and INT8 precisions. 
              They were then evaluated on their multi-classification performance and computational efficiency. 
              The models’ CPU utilization and resident set size were measured to quantify their resource requirements.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              This experiment evaluates the models’ ability to generalise towards zero-day attacks. 
              The baseline models were retrained with the DoS and DDoS attack types  removed from training and validation sets. 
              They were evaluated based on the amount of zero-day attacks they were able to flag.

             </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
            My literature review summarises current academic research on AI-IDSs for resource-constrained networks. 
            It compares traditional IDSs with AI-based methods by evaluating machine learning such as Support Vector 
            Machines, Logistic Regression and K-means clustering for preprocessing and deep learning architectures 
            such as CNNs, Autoencoders and GANs for improved detection. In this review I note that hybrid models 
            strike a more effective balance between accuracy and efficiency, forming the foundation for the project’s 
            CNN, CNN-GRU, and GAN-MLP implementations.

             </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
            My final paper outlines the LAIDS project’s complete methodology for developing and evaluating the proposed
             CNN-GRU and GAN-MLP models. It details the evaluation framework used to assess model performance across 
             multiple criteria, including multi-classification ability, resource efficiency and ability to detect 
             zero-day attacks. My paper also examines post-training quantization techniques and their impact on model 
             size and computational performance, providing a comprehensive summary of the LAIDS project’s experimental 
             design and implementation process for the 1D and 2D CNNs as well as the proposed CNN-GRU and GAN-MLP 
             models.
